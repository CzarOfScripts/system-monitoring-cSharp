<h1 align = "center">System Monitoring</h1>

This program is designed to monitor various computer sensors, providing information on:

- Current keyboard layout
- CPU usage and temperatures
- GPU usage and temperatures
- RAM usage, load, and available space
- System uptime

Additionally, the program employs color coding to visually represent the load and temperature status.

## Motivation

This project marks my first experience in C#. It was initially created to fulfill my personal requirements, but I've decided to share it with the community for anyone who might find it useful.
